# Outbreak
Clone of the game "Breakout". Made in Unity, initially finished in August 2018
Made quickly in one day as a proof of concept. Finishing the level isn't very rewarding (especially when you have your last brick) and doesn't progress.
Sound would be nice. 

# Known Bugs:
  1. Hitting the paddle can occasionally move it slightly.
    
# Usage
  Downloading the zip file should contain all materials require to start the game.
